## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this project, the goal was to build reuseable components for the repeated UI elements thoughout the design specifications.

### Continued development

- Utilize more React Hooks (Reducer and Context)
- Better CSS styling/management or use Preprocessor
- Learn to use Grid more often, always doing Flexbox
